Objectives: 
Create an automated tool to theorycraft the new item system and get ahead of the meta
Teach Sal how to use Git so he doesn’t sound like a dumbass at work
Use Python or Javascript or both so that Sal can get more hands on experience

MVP: 
Figure out the most efficient items based on the new league system coming in Preseason 11
Have an updatable list/dictionary of the items in the game to adapt to the balancing of the league season
Use the base components of league to calculate the efficiencies of the newest items (ex. 1 ad =3.5 gold from long sword)
Full Release:
Input a champion name, find what stats/items are relevant, and give the top 5 most efficient items for the champion (excluding actives) with their % gold efficiency
Assign tier values to passives to account for their effectiveness and make a more accurate list ex. Sheen passive is tier 2 and worth 300 gold vs tri force passive is tier 1 and worth 500 gold
Separate relevant boots category, not to be included in the main item list (ex. don’t recommend sorc shoes for vayne
Future Scope:
Have the game pull from the Riot API what champs are in your game and recommend items based on the data (4 ad--> recommend building extra armor)
